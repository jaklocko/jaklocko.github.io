					<h3>My Story</h3>
					<p>In May 2016, I was elated to be accepted into the Ikigai class of <a href="https://www.remoteyear.com" style="text-decoration: none;">Remote Year</a>. At the time, I was working in IT Operations. I had been for 5 years. But I was not as happy with it as I would have hoped to be. There was something missing. During that experience, I was lucky to work alongside some truly exceptional developers. It was in December 2016 that I decided to take a different path in my career. I quit my operations job and began studying as a web developer.</p>
