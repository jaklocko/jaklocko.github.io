							<p>Better than a bank vault! You can't keep your money in two different places, but we can do it with your data, and the result is higher protection for you! We recognize the importance of data protection and go to great lengths to protect and secure our client data. For security your data is coded into one of several available encryption algorithms and key strengths up to 128-bit AES. The online backup software transmits data to two separate Tier One data centers. Redundant fail-safe systems protect the data in every step of the backup and storage process. Both the primary center and the secondary remote centers are hardened and heavily secured, like bank vaults for your data, only better.

					<h2>About Us</h2>
					<hr class="short_divider">
					<h4>Our Beginnings</h4>
					<p>Dakotech was founded in 1999 in Detroit, MI as a small part-time Information Technology consulting and support business. In 2003, Dakotech moved to Ann Arbor, MI to better serve the Southeastern Michigan area as we felt that it would be best to position ourselves in a technology corridor. What started out as two employees driving around door-to-door in an old Volkswagon soon became a full-time operation catering primarily to law firms, professional offices, and other small businesses.</p>
					<p>Having had the fortune to land some of our most dedicated and successful clients in the first few years of business, we have carried some of the top law offices to the very edge of high technology. We strive to maintain the highest level of customer service, ethical billing, and a leading-edge knowledge base. We understand that not everyone is as attuned to technology as we are, and we do what it takes to get you excited about the terrifying prospects of technology.</p>
